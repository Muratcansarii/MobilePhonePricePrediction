# MobilePhonePricePrediction
This project takes a dataset specifying the features of smartphones and trains it with ML to give a price for each smartphone.
I use Python, scikit-learn and pandas libraries, linear regression and random forest classifier algorithms.

test_data2.csv: Dataset containing the features of smartphones.
MobilePhoneDataset2.csv: Dataset containing the calculated prices according to the algorithm's price prediction.

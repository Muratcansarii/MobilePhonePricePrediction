# MobilePhonePricePrediction
This project takes a dataset specifying the features of smartphones and trains it with ML to give a price for each smartphone.
I use Python, scikit-learn and pandas libraries, linear regression and random forest classifier algorithms.

MobilePhoneDataset2.csv dataset contains the calculated prices according to the algorithm's price prediction.
